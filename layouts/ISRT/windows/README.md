# ISRT Windows (WIP)

In the [src](./src) directory you will find the source files for the distributed files. We used [MSKLC (Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator)](https://msklc-guide.github.io/) to create them.

Variants
- ANSI

## Usage

### Install

1. Go to the [dist](./dist) directory and go inside the layout version that you wish to use.
2. Install it using `setup.exe`.
3. Now you can use `âŠž Win` + `Spacebar` to switch layouts.

### Uninstall

1. Go to the [dist](./dist) directory and go inside the layout version that you want to uninstall.
2. Run `setup.exe` and select the `Uninstall` option.

## Good to know

- When using MKLC shortcuts are not automatically updated so we will have to edit the `.klc` directly.
